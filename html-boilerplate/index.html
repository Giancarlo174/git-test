    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Giancarlo</strong>, and I am <em>excited</em> to become a <strong>software developer</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Why I Chose This Path</h2>
        <p>I have always loved creating things. Programming allows me to <strong>build solutions</strong> that help others, and that's very meaningful to me.</p>
    
        <h3>My First Experience with Programming</h3>
            <p>When I started with <em>Python</em>, I felt like I was truly discovering a way to make my ideas come to life!</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>I plan to study step by step and eventually <strong>build, create, and invent</strong> amazing things.</p>

    <p>This is all for me by now, hope to share with you how I'm doing the next time. Keep safe, enjoy yourself and never forget to <em>smell your roses</em>.</p>
